# Architecture Standards

This document defines the centralized standards and requirements that apply to all architectural components of the Cash Sync application. This serves as a **single source of truth** for architectural standards to eliminate duplication across documentation.

> **üéØ DRY PRINCIPLE**: This document follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle. Standards defined here should be referenced by other documentation rather than duplicated. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for our DRY guidelines.

## üìã Standards Overview

> **üìã ARCHITECTURE STANDARDS - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH**
> 
> These are the official architectural standards for the Cash Sync project. All other documentation should reference these standards rather than duplicating them.

## üß™ Testing Standards

### Coverage Requirements
- **Overall Project**: See [official coverage requirements](testing-standards/tools-and-automation/coverage_requirements.md)
- **Individual Components**: Must meet project-level coverage requirements
- **New Code**: Must meet new code coverage requirements
- **Critical Modules**: Must meet critical module coverage requirements

### Testing Patterns
- **Unit Tests**: Each component has dedicated unit tests following our test patterns
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction tests validate proper communication
- **Mock Testing**: External dependencies are mocked for isolated testing
- **Property-Based Testing**: Use hypothesis for comprehensive validation

## üìù Code Standards

### PEP 8 Compliance
- **Style Guidelines**: All code follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- **Line Length**: Maximum 88 characters (Black formatter)
- **Import Organization**: Standard import order and grouping
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent naming across all components

### Type Hints
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Type hints throughout all code
- **Abstract Methods**: All abstract methods include type hints
- **Function Signatures**: Complete type annotations for all functions
- **Return Types**: Explicit return type annotations

### Documentation
- **Docstrings**: Comprehensive docstrings for all public APIs including:
  - **Args Section**: Document all parameters with types and descriptions
  - **Returns Section**: Document return values with types and descriptions
  - **Raises Section**: Document exceptions that may be raised
  - **Examples**: Include usage examples for complex methods
- **Component Documentation**: Each component is well-documented
- **Architecture Documentation**: Clear architectural documentation
- **User Guides**: Clear, actionable documentation for end users

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling Standards

### Error Handling Patterns
- **Consistent Patterns**: Consistent error handling patterns across all components
- **Graceful Degradation**: Components handle missing dependencies gracefully
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error messages with actionable guidance
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging with appropriate detail levels

**Detailed Implementation**: See [ADR-006: Error Handling Strategy](adrs/006-error-handling-strategy.md) for comprehensive error handling architecture and implementation patterns.

### Input Validation
- **Layer-Specific Validation**: Each layer validates inputs appropriate to its responsibility
- **Bank-Specific Validation**: Each implementation validates bank-specific input formats
- **GUI Validation**: All GUI inputs are validated before processing
- **Data Sanitization**: Infrastructure layer handles data sanitization

## üîí Security Standards

### Security Compliance
- **Input Validation**: Each layer validates inputs appropriate to its responsibility
- **Data Sanitization**: Infrastructure layer handles data sanitization
- **Access Control**: Presentation layer controls user access to functionality
- **File System Security**: Path validation and safe file operations

## üìä Performance Standards

### Performance Characteristics
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage and cleanup
- **Processing Speed**: Optimized algorithms and batch processing
- **Scalability**: Modular design supports easy extension
- **Resource Usage**: Minimal resource footprint

## üîÑ Maintenance Standards

### Documentation Maintenance
- **Cross-Reference Maintenance**: Keep all cross-references current and accurate
- **ADR Updates**: Update ADR status when decisions change
- **Testing Alignment**: Ensure testing standards reflect architectural requirements
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistency across all documentation

### Code Maintenance
- **Refactoring**: Regular refactoring to maintain code quality
- **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies current and secure
- **Technical Debt**: Address technical debt regularly
- **Code Reviews**: Comprehensive code review process

## üìö Reference Standards

### Architecture Decision Records
- **ADR Format**: Follow standard format in `docs/adrs/README.md`
- **ADR Naming**: Use `{number}-{title}.md` convention
- **ADR Status**: Track status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, etc.)
- **ADR Review**: Regular review and update process

### Testing Integration
- **Test Organization**: Tests mirror the architectural structure
- **Test Implementation**: Follow patterns in `docs/testing-standards/`
- **Coverage Enforcement**: Automated coverage checking
- **Quality Gates**: Coverage and quality gates in CI/CD

## üéØ Usage Guidelines

### For Architecture Documentation
When documenting architectural decisions or components:

1. **Reference Standards**: Link to this document rather than repeating standards
2. **Use Templates**: Use standard templates for consistency
3. **Maintain Links**: Keep all cross-references current
4. **Update Regularly**: Review and update standards as needed

### For ADRs
When creating or updating ADRs:

1. **Reference Standards**: Link to relevant sections of this document
2. **Avoid Duplication**: Don't repeat standards that are defined here
3. **Focus on Decisions**: Focus on the specific architectural decision
4. **Maintain Compliance**: Ensure compliance with these standards

### For Code Reviews
When reviewing code:

1. **Check Standards**: Verify compliance with these standards
2. **Reference Documentation**: Ensure documentation follows these guidelines
3. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure consistency across components
4. **Update Standards**: Propose updates to standards when needed
