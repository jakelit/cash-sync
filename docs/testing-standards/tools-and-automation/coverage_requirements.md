# Coverage Requirements and Standards

This document defines our code coverage standards, measurement practices, and enforcement policies.

## üìä Coverage Thresholds

### Minimum Requirements

| Component Type | Line Coverage | Branch Coverage | Notes |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Core Business Logic** | 95% | 90% | Critical path functionality |
| **API Endpoints** | 90% | 85% | Public interfaces |
| **Data Processing** | 90% | 85% | Data transformation logic |
| **Utility Functions** | 85% | 80% | Helper and support functions |
| **Integration Code** | 80% | 75% | External system interfaces |
| **Configuration** | 70% | 65% | Settings and configuration |

### Project-Level Targets

> **üìã COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH**
> 
> These are the official coverage requirements for the Cash Sync project. All other documentation should reference these values.
> 
> **üéØ DRY PRINCIPLE**: This document follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle. Coverage requirements defined here should be referenced by other documentation rather than duplicated.

- **Overall Project:** 90% line coverage, 85% branch coverage
- **New Code:** 95% line coverage, 90% branch coverage
- **Critical Modules:** 95% line coverage, 95% branch coverage

### Coverage Constants

For programmatic access and documentation consistency:

```python
# Coverage thresholds - single source of truth
PROJECT_LINE_COVERAGE = 90
PROJECT_BRANCH_COVERAGE = 85
NEW_CODE_LINE_COVERAGE = 95
NEW_CODE_BRANCH_COVERAGE = 90
CRITICAL_MODULE_COVERAGE = 95
```

## üìã Coverage Analysis Guidelines

### What to Measure

#### ‚úÖ Include in Coverage
- **Business logic functions** - Core application functionality
- **API endpoint handlers** - Request/response processing
- **Data validation** - Input sanitization and validation
- **Error handling paths** - Exception handling and recovery
- **State management** - Object lifecycle and state transitions
- **Integration points** - External service interfaces
- **Security checks** - Authentication and authorization
- **Configuration loading** - Application setup and configuration

#### ‚ùå Exclude from Coverage
- **Third-party code** - External libraries and frameworks
- **Generated code** - Auto-generated files (migrations, protobuf)
- **Development tools** - Debug utilities and development helpers
- **Platform-specific code** - OS-specific implementations (when not testable)
- **Deprecated code** - Code marked for removal
- **Import statements** - Simple module imports
- **Type definitions** - Type hints and protocol definitions

### Coverage Quality Metrics

#### Line Coverage
```python
# Good: Covers all execution paths
def calculate_discount(price, customer_type):
    if customer_type == "premium":
        return price * 0.9  # Covered by test
    elif customer_type == "regular":
        return price * 0.95  # Covered by test
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid customer type")  # Covered by test
```

#### Branch Coverage
```python
# Example: Testing all branches
def process_payment(amount, payment_method):
    if amount <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Amount must be positive")  # Branch 1
    
    if payment_method == "credit":
        return process_credit_payment(amount)  # Branch 2
    elif payment_method == "debit":
        return process_debit_payment(amount)   # Branch 3
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid payment method")  # Branch 4

# Test should cover all 4 branches
```

# Append to existing coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-append

# Coverage for specific modules
pytest --cov=src.banking --cov=src.payments tests/
```

## üìä Coverage Reporting and Analysis

### HTML Report Features

The HTML coverage report provides:

1. **Overview Page**: Overall statistics and module breakdown
2. **Module Pages**: Line-by-line coverage for each file
3. **Context Information**: Which tests cover each line
4. **Missing Coverage**: Highlighted uncovered lines
5. **Branch Information**: Conditional branch coverage details

### Reading Coverage Reports

#### Terminal Report
```
Name                      Stmts   Miss Branch BrPart  Cover   Missing
---------------------------------------------------------------------
src/banking/__init__.py       2      0      0      0   100%
src/banking/account.py       45      2     12      1    94%   23, 67
src/banking/payment.py       38      5      8      2    84%   12, 34-38, 45
src/banking/utils.py         20      0      4      0   100%
---------------------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                       105      7     24      3    91%
```

#### Understanding the Columns
- **Stmts**: Total executable statements
- **Miss**: Uncovered statements
- **Branch**: Total branches (if/else, loops, etc.)
- **BrPart**: Partially covered branches
- **Cover**: Coverage percentage
- **Missing**: Line numbers of uncovered code

### JSON Report Analysis

```python
# scripts/analyze_coverage.py
"""Analyze coverage JSON report for insights."""

import json
from pathlib import Path

def analyze_coverage_report():
    """Analyze coverage.json for detailed insights."""
    with open('coverage.json') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    
    # Overall statistics
    total_coverage = data['totals']['percent_covered']
    print(f"Overall coverage: {total_coverage:.2f}%")
    
    # Module analysis
    files = data['files']
    low_coverage_files = []
    
    for filepath, stats in files.items():
        coverage = stats['summary']['percent_covered']
        if coverage < 80:
            low_coverage_files.append((filepath, coverage))
    
    # Report low coverage files
    if low_coverage_files:
        print("\nFiles with coverage below 80%:")
        for filepath, coverage in sorted(low_coverage_files, key=lambda x: x[1]):
            print(f"  {filepath}: {coverage:.2f}%")
    
    # Missing coverage analysis
    for filepath, stats in files.items():
        missing_lines = stats['missing_lines']
        if missing_lines:
            print(f"\n{filepath} missing coverage on lines: {missing_lines}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    analyze_coverage_report()
```

## üö® Coverage Enforcement

```

### Quality Gates

```python
# scripts/coverage_gate.py
"""Enforce coverage quality gates."""

import sys
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
from pathlib import Path

def check_coverage_gate():
    """Check if coverage meets quality gate requirements."""
    coverage_xml = Path("coverage.xml")
    
    if not coverage_xml.exists():
        print("‚ùå Coverage report not found")
        return False
    
    tree = ET.parse(coverage_xml)
    root = tree.getroot()
    
    # Overall coverage
    line_rate = float(root.get('line-rate', 0)) * 100
    branch_rate = float(root.get('branch-rate', 0)) * 100
    
    print(f"Line Coverage: {line_rate:.2f}%")
    print(f"Branch Coverage: {branch_rate:.2f}%")
    
    # Check thresholds
    line_threshold = 90
    branch_threshold = 85
    
    if line_rate < line_threshold:
        print(f"‚ùå Line coverage {line_rate:.2f}% below threshold {line_threshold}%")
        return False
    
    if branch_rate < branch_threshold:
        print(f"‚ùå Branch coverage {branch_rate:.2f}% below threshold {branch_threshold}%")
        return False
    
    # Check per-file coverage
    for package in root.findall(".//package"):
        for class_elem in package.findall("classes/class"):
            filename = class_elem.get('filename')
            class_line_rate = float(class_elem.get('line-rate', 0)) * 100
            
            # Special requirements for critical files
            if 'banking' in filename and class_line_rate < 95:
                print(f"‚ùå Critical file {filename} coverage {class_line_rate:.2f}% below 95%")
                return False
    
    print("‚úÖ All coverage gates passed")
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    success = check_coverage_gate()
    sys.exit(0 if success else 1)
```

## üìà Coverage Improvement Strategies

### Identifying Coverage Gaps

1. **Missing Line Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Find uncovered lines
   coverage report --show-missing
   
   # Focus on specific modules
   coverage report --include="src/banking/*" --show-missing
   ```

2. **Branch Coverage Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Detailed branch information
   coverage html
   # Open htmlcov/index.html and review branch coverage
   ```

3. **Context Analysis**
   ```bash
   # See which tests cover which lines
   coverage html --show-contexts
   ```

### Writing Tests for Coverage

#### Target Uncovered Lines
```python
# Before: Uncovered error handling
def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")  # Uncovered
    return a / b

# Test to cover error case
def test_divide_by_zero_raises_error():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Cannot divide by zero"):
        divide(10, 0)
```

#### Cover All Branches
```python
# Before: Missing branch coverage
def calculate_grade(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"  # Covered
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"  # Covered
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"  # Not covered
    else:
        return "F"  # Not covered

# Add tests for missing branches
@pytest.mark.parametrize("score,expected", [
    (95, "A"),  # Existing
    (85, "B"),  # Existing
    (75, "C"),  # New test
    (65, "F"),  # New test
])
def test_calculate_grade(score, expected):
    assert calculate_grade(score) == expected
```

### Property-Based Testing for Coverage

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100))
def test_grade_calculation_comprehensive(score):
    """Property-based test to ensure all score ranges are covered."""
    grade = calculate_grade(score)
    
    if score >= 90:
        assert grade == "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        assert grade == "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        assert grade == "C"
    else:
        assert grade == "F"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Coverage Best Practices

### Do's

1. **Focus on Meaningful Coverage**
   - Test business logic thoroughly
   - Cover error handling paths
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions

2. **Use Coverage to Guide Testing**
   - Identify untested code paths
   - Ensure critical functionality is covered
   - Review coverage reports regularly

3. **Combine Coverage Types**
   - Use both line and branch coverage
   - Consider path coverage for complex logic
   - Monitor coverage trends over time

4. **Integrate with Development Workflow**
   - Run coverage checks in CI/CD
   - Set up pre-commit hooks
   - Include coverage in code reviews

### Don'ts

1. **Don't Chase 100% Coverage Blindly**
   - Some code doesn't need testing (simple getters/setters)
   - Platform-specific code may not be testable
   - Focus on quality over quantity

2. **Don't Write Tests Just for Coverage**
   - Tests should verify behavior, not just execute code
   - Meaningless tests provide false confidence
   - Focus on valuable test scenarios

3. **Don't Ignore Context**
   - High coverage doesn't guarantee good tests
   - Consider the quality of test assertions
   - Review what each test actually verifies
