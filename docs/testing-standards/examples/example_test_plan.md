# Test Plan for `BankAccount` Class

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Author:** Development Team  
**Reviewer:** QA Team  

## Introduction

The `BankAccount` class manages individual bank account operations including deposits, withdrawals, balance tracking, and transaction history. This test plan ensures comprehensive coverage of all account operations, error handling, and edge cases.

**Class Location:** `src/banking/bank_account.py`  
**Test Location:** `tests/test_bank_account.py`  

## Test Objectives

- [x] Verify functional correctness of all public methods
- [x] Ensure proper error handling and exception scenarios
- [x] Validate edge cases and boundary conditions
- [x] Confirm transaction history accuracy
- [x] Test account state management
- [x] Validate security considerations for financial operations

## Test Environment

- **Python Version:** 3.9+
- **Primary Framework:** pytest
- **Additional Libraries:**
  - `pytest-cov` (coverage reporting)
  - `pytest-mock` (mocking utilities)
  - `hypothesis` (property-based testing)
  - `decimal` (precise financial calculations)
- **External Dependencies:** None (isolated unit testing)

## Test Scope

### In Scope
- Account initialization and configuration
- Deposit operations (positive amounts, zero amounts)
- Withdrawal operations (sufficient/insufficient funds)
- Balance calculations and retrievals
- Transaction history tracking
- Account status management (active, frozen, closed)
- Interest calculation (if applicable)
- Account validation and constraints

### Out of Scope
- Database persistence (mocked)
- External payment gateway integration (mocked)
- Multi-threading/concurrency (separate test suite)
- Performance benchmarking (separate performance tests)

### Dependencies

- **Stubbed:** Configuration management, audit systems

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
Individual method testing in isolation with mocked dependencies

### Integration Tests
Account interaction with transaction logging and audit systems

### Property-Based Tests
Comprehensive validation using `hypothesis` for balance consistency

### Security Tests
Input validation, overflow protection, unauthorized access prevention

## Test Data Strategy

### Valid Input Examples
- **Balances:** 0, 100.50, 1000, 999999.99
- **Account Types:** "checking", "savings", "business"
- **Amounts:** 0.01, 50, 1000, 999999.99

### Invalid Input Examples
- **Negative balances:** -1, -100.50
- **Invalid types:** None, "invalid", 123
- **Invalid amounts:** -50, "not_a_number", None, float('inf')

### Test Data Generation
- **Static Data:** Predefined valid account configurations
- **Generated Data:** Hypothesis strategies for amounts and account parameters
- **Edge Cases:** Boundary values, extreme numbers, special float values

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow PEP 8 for test code formatting
- Use descriptive test method names (e.g., `test_deposit_positive_amount_increases_balance`)
- Include docstrings for complex test scenarios
- Use type hints in test code
- Maintain consistent assertion styles using pytest assertions

### Test Organization
```python
class TestBankAccountInit:
    """Test account initialization and configuration."""
    
class TestBankAccountDeposits:
    """Test deposit operations and validation."""
    
class TestBankAccountWithdrawals:
    """Test withdrawal operations and error handling."""
    
class TestBankAccountStateManagement:
    """Test account status changes (freeze, close, etc.)."""
    
class TestBankAccountIntegration:
    """Test interactions between account operations."""
```

### Mocking Strategy
- **Database operations:** Mock using `pytest-mock`
- **External APIs:** Mock HTTP clients and responses
- **Time operations:** Mock datetime for consistent timestamps
- **Logging:** Capture log output for verification

## Test Execution

### Basic Execution
```bash
# Run all bank account tests
pytest tests/test_bank_account.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src/banking/bank_account --cov-report=html tests/test_bank_account.py

# Run specific test categories
pytest -m "unit" tests/test_bank_account.py
pytest -m "integration" tests/test_bank_account.py
pytest -m "not slow" tests/test_bank_account.py
```

### Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum Line Coverage:** 95%
- **Minimum Branch Coverage:** 90%
- **Coverage Exclusions:** Exception handling for system errors only

## Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions
- Decimal precision sufficient for financial calculations

- Currency conversion not implemented
- Interest calculation simplified (annual rate only)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Priority should be given to High priority test cases
- Property-based tests should run with at least 1000 examples
- Security tests must be reviewed by the security team
- Performance baselines should be established before optimization
