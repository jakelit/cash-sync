# Venmo Transaction Importer Specification

## Overview
The Venmo Transaction Importer allows users to import financial transaction data from Venmo CSV export files into a structured Excel table for tracking and analysis. This importer handles Venmo's unique CSV format, maps it to the standard format, checks for duplicates, and appends new transactions to the "Transactions" table in the specified Excel file.

## Venmo CSV Format Analysis

### Expected CSV Structure
Venmo exports transaction data in CSV format with a specific structure that includes header information and transaction data:

**File Structure:**
- **Line 1**: Account Statement header with username (e.g., "Account Statement - (@username)")
- **Line 2**: "Account Activity" section header
- **Line 3**: Column headers (first column is blank, followed by actual column headers)
- **Line 4**: Beginning Balance row (only contains value in "Beginning Balance" column)
- **Line 5+**: Transaction data rows (actual transaction records)
- **Last line**: Ending Balance row with legal disclaimer (contains values in "Ending Balance", "Statement Period Venmo Fees", and "Disclaimer" columns, where the Disclaimer column contains multi-line legal text)

**Important Format Notes:**
- The first column is empty/blank (no header)
- Column headers are on the 3rd line, not the 1st line
- Line 4 contains only the beginning balance (no transaction data)
- Transaction data starts from line 5
- The last line contains ending balance, fees, and legal disclaimer (no transaction data)
- The legal disclaimer is a multi-line value within the "Disclaimer" column of the last row
- Only rows with valid transaction IDs should be processed as transactions

**Transaction Columns (starting from 2nd column):**
- `ID` - Unique transaction identifier (e.g., "4345080794249066591")
- `Datetime` - Transaction date and time in ISO format (e.g., "2025-06-01T01:39:54")
- `Type` - Transaction type (e.g., "Payment")
- `Status` - Transaction status (e.g., "Complete")
- `Note` - User-provided note/description (e.g., "Dinner payment", "Coffee", "Rent")
- `From` - Sender's full name (e.g., "John Smith")
- `To` - Recipient's full name (e.g., "Jane Doe")
- `Amount (total)` - Transaction amount with sign and currency (e.g., "- $50.00", "+ $25.00")
- `Amount (tip)` - Tip amount (usually empty for personal payments)
- `Amount (tax)` - Tax amount (usually 0 for personal payments)
- `Amount (fee)` - Venmo fee amount (usually 0 for personal payments)
- `Tax Rate` - Tax rate percentage
- `Tax Exempt` - Tax exemption status
- `Funding Source` - Source of funds (e.g., "Venmo balance", empty for received payments)
- `Destination` - Account destination (e.g., "Venmo balance")
- `Beginning Balance` - Account balance at start of statement period
- `Ending Balance` - Account balance at end of statement period
- `Statement Period Venmo Fees` - Total fees for the statement period
- `Terminal Location` - Location information (usually empty)
- `Year to Date Venmo Fees` - YTD fee total
- `Disclaimer` - Legal disclaimer text

- Last line contains ending balance (`$1,407.50`), fees (`$0.00`), and multi-line legal disclaimer
- The legal disclaimer spans multiple lines within a single CSV cell (quoted value)

### Data Mapping Requirements
The importer must map Venmo-specific fields to the standardized Excel format:

| Venmo Field      | Standard Field     | Notes                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Datetime`       | `Date`             | Parse ISO datetime format (e.g., "2025-06-01T01:39:54") to date only |
| `From`/`To`      | `Description`      | Use From field for credits, To field for debits                      |
| `Amount (total)` | `Amount`           | Parse currency format (e.g., "- $50.00") to numeric, preserve sign   |
| `Note`           | `Notes`            | Include original note text                                           |
| `Type`           | `Notes`            | Include the original Venmo transaction type in the Notes field       |

## Implementation Requirements

### Class Structure
Create `VenmoImporter` class in `src/cash_sync/venmo_importer.py` that inherits from `BaseImporter`.

### Required Methods
The importer must implement the following methods:
- `get_expected_columns()` - Return the expected Venmo CSV columns as defined in the data mapping table above
- `get_institution_name()` - Return "Venmo"
- `get_account_name()` - Extract username from line 1 CSV header (e.g., "Account Statement - (@username)") and return as account name
- `read_csv_data()` - Override base method to handle Venmo's unconventional CSV format with multi-line headers and blank first column
- `parse_transaction_date()` - Override base method to handle ISO datetime format (e.g., "2025-06-01T01:39:54")
- `parse_transaction_amount()` - Parse currency format (e.g., "- $50.00", "+ $25.00") to numeric, preserve sign. Negative = money sent (debit), positive = money received (credit)

### Column Mapping Configuration
In the constructor of `VenmoImporter`, use the `set_column_mapping` method (inherited from `BaseImporter`) to map Venmo's CSV column names to the standardized internal column names. For example:

### CSV Reading Implementation
The `VenmoImporter` must override the `read_csv_data()` method to handle Venmo's unconventional CSV format:

**Key Implementation Requirements:**
1. **Header Processing**: Read the first line to extract username from "Account Statement - (@username)" format
2. **Data Section Identification**: Skip lines 1-3 (header and "Account Activity" section) to find the actual column headers
3. **Blank Column Handling**: Remove the blank first column that appears in all Venmo CSV files
4. **Balance Row Filtering**: Skip line 4 (beginning balance row) and last line (ending balance/fees/disclaimer row)
5. **Transaction Validation**: Ensure only rows with valid transaction IDs are included as transactions
6. **Multi-line Handling**: Handle the multi-line legal disclaimer within the last row's "Disclaimer" column

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Read the file line by line to extract account name from line 1
2. Find the "Account Activity" section to locate the start of column headers
3. Use `pandas.read_csv()` with `skiprows` parameter to start from line 3 (column headers)
4. Remove the blank first column using DataFrame slicing
5. Filter out balance rows (line 4 and last line) that don't contain transaction data
6. Filter out rows without valid transaction IDs (empty or non-numeric ID values)
7. Handle multi-line legal disclaimer within the last row's "Disclaimer" column
8. Return a clean DataFrame with only transaction data

**Example Implementation Structure:**
```python
def read_csv_data(self, csv_file: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Read file line by line to extract account name from line 1
    # Find "Account Activity" section to locate column headers
    # Read CSV with skiprows=2 to start from line 3 (column headers)
    # Remove blank first column using DataFrame slicing
    # Filter out balance rows (line 4 and last line)
    # Filter out rows without valid transaction IDs
    # Handle multi-line legal disclaimer in last row's "Disclaimer" column
    # Return clean DataFrame with only transaction data
```

## Integration Requirements

### GUI Integration
Add Venmo to the bank selection dropdown in the importer GUI.

### CLI Integration
Add Venmo to the available banks in the CLI interface.

### Import Statement
Add import statement in the main package initialization.

## Error Handling

### CSV Format Validation
- Validate that required columns are present (starting from 2nd column due to blank first column)
- Handle missing or malformed ISO datetime values
- Validate amount fields are in currency format
- Handle empty or null values gracefully
- Skip header rows (lines 1-3) and footer disclaimer text
- Handle the blank first column in all data rows
- Validate that transaction data starts from line 5 (after beginning balance row)
- Filter out balance rows (line 4 and last line) that don't contain transaction data
- Validate that only rows with valid transaction IDs are processed as transactions
- Parse username from header line (e.g., "Account Statement - (@username)") for account identification
- Handle file reading errors in the `read_csv_data()` method
- Validate CSV structure before attempting to parse transaction data
- Handle multi-line values within CSV cells (legal disclaimer in "Disclaimer" column)

### Data Quality Checks
- Verify transaction dates are within reasonable range
- Validate amount values are not zero or extreme values
- Check for malformed description strings
- Handle special characters in notes and descriptions

### Error Messages
Provide clear error messages for:
- Missing required CSV columns
- Invalid ISO datetime formats
- Non-currency format amount values
- File access issues
- Header/footer parsing issues
- Invalid CSV structure (missing "Account Activity" section)
- Malformed header line (missing username extraction)
- File encoding issues during CSV reading
- Missing or invalid transaction data (no valid transaction rows found)
- Balance row parsing issues (beginning/ending balance rows not found)
- Multi-line CSV parsing issues (legal disclaimer handling)

## Testing
See the dedicated [Venmo Importer Test Plan](../test-plans/venmo-importer-test-plan.md) for comprehensive testing requirements, test cases, and validation criteria.
