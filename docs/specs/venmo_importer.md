# Venmo Transaction Importer Specification

## Overview
The Venmo Transaction Importer allows users to import financial transaction data from Venmo CSV export files into a structured Excel table for tracking and analysis. This importer handles Venmo's unique CSV format, maps it to the standard format, checks for duplicates, and appends new transactions to the "Transactions" table in the specified Excel file.

## Venmo CSV Format Analysis

### Expected CSV Structure
Venmo exports transaction data in CSV format with a specific structure that includes header information and transaction data:

**File Structure:**
- **Line 1**: Account Statement header with username (e.g., "Account Statement - (@username)")
- **Line 2**: "Account Activity" section header
- **Line 3**: The first column is blank, followed by the column headers (actual transaction data starts from line 4)
- **Line 4+**: Transaction data rows
- **Last lines**: Summary information and legal disclaimer

**Important Format Notes:**
- The first column is empty/blank (no header)
- Column headers are on the 3rd line, not the 1st line
- Transaction data starts from the 4th line
- The file includes summary rows with balance information
- A lengthy legal disclaimer appears at the end

**Transaction Columns (starting from 2nd column):**
- `ID` - Unique transaction identifier (e.g., "4345080794249066591")
- `Datetime` - Transaction date and time in ISO format (e.g., "2025-06-01T01:39:54")
- `Type` - Transaction type (e.g., "Payment")
- `Status` - Transaction status (e.g., "Complete")
- `Note` - User-provided note/description (e.g., "Dinner payment", "Coffee", "Rent")
- `From` - Sender's full name (e.g., "John Smith")
- `To` - Recipient's full name (e.g., "Jane Doe")
- `Amount (total)` - Transaction amount with sign and currency (e.g., "- $50.00", "+ $25.00")
- `Amount (tip)` - Tip amount (usually empty for personal payments)
- `Amount (tax)` - Tax amount (usually 0 for personal payments)
- `Amount (fee)` - Venmo fee amount (usually 0 for personal payments)
- `Tax Rate` - Tax rate percentage
- `Tax Exempt` - Tax exemption status
- `Funding Source` - Source of funds (e.g., "Venmo balance", empty for received payments)
- `Destination` - Account destination (e.g., "Venmo balance")
- `Beginning Balance` - Account balance at start of statement period
- `Ending Balance` - Account balance at end of statement period
- `Statement Period Venmo Fees` - Total fees for the statement period
- `Terminal Location` - Location information (usually empty)
- `Year to Date Venmo Fees` - YTD fee total
- `Disclaimer` - Legal disclaimer text

### Data Mapping Requirements
The importer must map Venmo-specific fields to the standardized Excel format:

| Venmo Field      | Standard Field     | Notes                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Datetime`       | `Date`             | Parse ISO datetime format (e.g., "2025-06-01T01:39:54") to date only |
| `From`/`To`      | `Description`      | Use From field for credits, To field for debits                      |
| `Amount (total)` | `Amount`           | Parse currency format (e.g., "- $50.00") to numeric, preserve sign   |
| `Note`           | `Notes`            | Include original note text                                           |
| `Type`           | `Notes`            | Include the original Venmo transaction type in the Notes field       |

## Implementation Requirements

### Class Structure
Create `VenmoImporter` class in `src/cash_sync/venmo_importer.py` that inherits from `BaseImporter`.

### Required Methods
The importer must implement the following methods:
- `get_expected_columns()` - Return the expected Venmo CSV columns as defined in the data mapping table above
- `get_institution_name()` - Return "Venmo"
- `get_account_name()` - Extract username from line 1 CSV header (e.g., "Account Statement - (@username)") and return as account name
- `parse_transaction_date()` - Override base method to handle ISO datetime format (e.g., "2025-06-01T01:39:54")
- `parse_transaction_amount()` - Parse currency format (e.g., "- $50.00", "+ $25.00") to numeric, preserve sign. Negative = money sent (debit), positive = money received (credit)

### Column Mapping Configuration
In the constructor of `VenmoImporter`, use the `set_column_mapping` method (inherited from `BaseImporter`) to map Venmo's CSV column names to the standardized internal column names. For example:

## Integration Requirements

### GUI Integration
Add Venmo to the bank selection dropdown in the importer GUI.

### CLI Integration
Add Venmo to the available banks in the CLI interface.

### Import Statement
Add import statement in the main package initialization.

## Error Handling

### CSV Format Validation
- Validate that required columns are present (starting from 2nd column due to blank first column)
- Handle missing or malformed ISO datetime values
- Validate amount fields are in currency format
- Handle empty or null values gracefully
- Skip header rows (lines 1-3) and footer disclaimer text
- Handle the blank first column in all data rows
- Validate that transaction data starts from line 4
- Parse username from header line (e.g., "Account Statement - (@username)") for account identification

### Data Quality Checks
- Verify transaction dates are within reasonable range
- Validate amount values are not zero or extreme values
- Check for malformed description strings
- Handle special characters in notes and descriptions

### Error Messages
Provide clear error messages for:
- Missing required CSV columns
- Invalid ISO datetime formats
- Non-currency format amount values
- File access issues
- Header/footer parsing issues

## Testing
See the dedicated [Venmo Importer Test Plan](../test-plans/venmo-importer-test-plan.md) for comprehensive testing requirements, test cases, and validation criteria.

## Performance Considerations

### Large File Handling
- Efficient CSV parsing for large transaction files
- Memory management for bulk imports
- Progress reporting for long-running imports

### Duplicate Detection
- Optimize duplicate checking for Venmo's transaction patterns
- Handle Venmo's unique transaction identifiers
- Consider time-based duplicate detection

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- Ensure sensitive information in notes is handled appropriately
- Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Sanitize user input in descriptions and notes

### File Validation
- Verify CSV file integrity before processing
- Check file size limits
- Validate file encoding (UTF-8 expected)

## Documentation Updates

### User Documentation
Update `docs/import_transactions.md` to include:
- Venmo in supported institutions list
- Venmo-specific usage instructions
- Example CSV format for Venmo

### Code Documentation
- Comprehensive docstrings for all methods

- Enhanced transaction categorization for Venmo patterns
- Support for Venmo business accounts
- Integration with Venmo's transaction categories

### Scalability
- Support for batch processing multiple Venmo files
- Incremental import capabilities
- Real-time transaction monitoring (future)
