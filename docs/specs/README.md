# Technical Specifications

This directory contains technical specifications for new features and components in the Cash Sync project.

## Purpose

Technical specifications (tech specs) provide detailed design documents for new features, components, or major changes to the system. They serve as the blueprint for implementation and help ensure consistency across the codebase.

## Organization

### File Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names with underscores: `feature_name_spec.md`
- Include the component type in the name when relevant: `venmo_importer.md`

### Specification Structure
Each tech spec should include:
1. **Overview** - High-level description of the feature
2. **Requirements** - Functional and non-functional requirements
3. **Implementation Details** - Technical implementation approach
4. **Integration Points** - How it fits into the existing system
5. **Testing Strategy** - Testing requirements and approach
6. **Timeline** - Implementation phases and milestones
7. **Success Criteria** - How success will be measured

## Current Specifications

- [Venmo Transaction Importer](venmo_importer.md) - Specification for importing Venmo CSV transaction files

## Related Documentation

- [Test Plans](../test-plans/) - Detailed test specifications
- [Testing Standards](../testing-standards/) - Testing guidelines and standards
- [Feature Documentation](../) - User-facing feature documentation

## Contributing

When creating a new tech spec:
1. Follow the established template and structure
2. Include comprehensive implementation details
3. Consider integration with existing components
4. Define clear testing requirements
5. Update this README with new specifications
