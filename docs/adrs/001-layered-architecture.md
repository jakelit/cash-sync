# ADR-001: Layered Architecture Pattern

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Cash Sync application needed a clear architectural structure that would:
- Separate concerns between different types of functionality
- Allow for easy testing and maintenance
- Support extensibility for new bank importers
- Provide clear interfaces between components
- Enable both GUI and command-line interfaces

The application handles financial data processing, user interface management, file operations, and business logic, requiring clear boundaries between these concerns.

## Decision

We adopted a layered architecture pattern with four distinct layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: GUI components and user interface logic
2. **Application Layer**: Application services and workflow orchestration
3. **Domain Layer**: Business logic and core domain entities
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: External dependencies and technical concerns

### Layer Responsibilities

#### Presentation Layer
- `main_gui.py`: Main application window and navigation
- `importer_gui.py`: Import operation user interface
- `auto_categorize_gui.py`: Auto-categorization user interface

#### Application Layer
- `__init__.py`: Application entry point and command-line interface
- `auto_categorizer.py`: Auto-categorization workflow orchestration

#### Domain Layer
- `importer_interface.py`: Abstract interface for importers
- `base_importer.py`: Base class for all importers
- `ally_importer.py`: Ally Bank-specific implementation
- `capital_one_importer.py`: Capital One-specific implementation

#### Infrastructure Layer
- `excel_handler.py`: Excel file operations
- `csv_handler.py`: CSV file operations
- `duplicate_checker.py`: Duplicate detection logic
- `logger.py`: Logging configuration

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a well-defined responsibility
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently with appropriate mocking
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't necessarily affect others
- **Extensibility**: New bank importers can be added without changing other layers
- **Flexibility**: Both GUI and command-line interfaces can use the same domain logic

### Negative Consequences
- **Complexity**: Additional abstraction layers increase initial complexity
- **Performance Overhead**: Multiple layer transitions may add slight performance overhead
- **Learning Curve**: New developers need to understand the layer boundaries

### Testing Implications
- **Unit Testing**: Each layer can be unit tested in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Layer boundaries can be tested for proper interaction
- **Mocking Strategy**: Infrastructure layer can be mocked for domain layer testing
- **Coverage Requirements**: Each layer must meet our [official coverage requirements](../testing-standards/tools-and-automation/coverage_requirements.md)

## Compliance

### Testing Standards Compliance
- **Unit Tests**: Each layer has dedicated unit tests following our test patterns
- **Integration Tests**: Layer interaction tests validate proper communication
- **Coverage**: All layers meet our [official coverage requirements](../testing-standards/tools-and-automation/coverage_requirements.md)
- **Test Organization**: Tests mirror the layered structure in the test directory

### Code Standards Compliance
See [Architecture Standards](../architecture-standards.md) for comprehensive code standards including:
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Style guidelines and formatting
- **Type Hints**: Comprehensive type annotations
- **Documentation**: Component and API documentation
- **Error Handling**: See [Architecture Standards](../architecture-standards.md) for error handling patterns

### Security Compliance
See [Architecture Standards](../architecture-standards.md) for comprehensive security standards including:
- **Input Validation**: Layer-specific validation requirements
- **Data Sanitization**: Infrastructure layer security
- **Access Control**: Presentation layer security controls
