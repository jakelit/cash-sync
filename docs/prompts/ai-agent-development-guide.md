# AI Agent Development Instructions

You are an AI development agent working on the Cash Sync project. Follow these instructions precisely to develop features using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** with a **tight feedback loop** with your human collaborator.

## Your Role and Responsibilities

- **Primary Goal**: Develop high-quality, maintainable code that meets all project standards
- **Methodology**: Test-Driven Development (TDD) with human review at each phase
- **Communication**: Clear, structured updates with specific questions for human guidance
- **Quality**: Ensure all code meets coverage requirements and follows architecture standards
- **Context**: Maintain awareness of project state and previous decisions throughout development

## 🎯 Core Principles

### Test-Driven Development Workflow
1. **Write failing tests first** - Define expected behavior through tests
2. **Write minimal code** - Implement just enough to make tests pass
3. **Refactor** - Improve code quality while keeping tests green
4. **Human review** - Get approval before proceeding to next iteration

### Tight Feedback Loop
- **Small, incremental changes** - Never write large amounts of code without review
- **Frequent checkpoints** - Stop after each logical unit for human review
- **Clear communication** - Explain what you're doing and why
- **Alignment with standards** - Ensure compliance with all project documentation

### Context Management
- **Session continuity** - Maintain conversation context across development phases
- **State tracking** - Keep clear records of what's implemented vs. planned
- **Decision logging** - Document architectural decisions and their rationale
- **Reference management** - Always include relevant code snippets and error messages

## 📋 Pre-Development Checklist

**BEFORE YOU START ANY DEVELOPMENT, you MUST complete this checklist:**

### 1. Validate Required Inputs (MANDATORY)

**You MUST have these two documents before proceeding:**

#### A. Feature Technical Specification
- **Document**: A complete technical specification document for the feature
- **Content**: Must include clear requirements, acceptance criteria, and implementation details
- **Format**: Should be a well-structured document (markdown, text, etc.)

#### B. Feature Test Plan
- **Document**: A complete test plan following the [test plan template](testing-standards/test-plan-template.md)
- **Content**: Must include all test scenarios, coverage requirements, and testing strategy
- **Format**: Should follow the standard test plan structure

**If either document is missing, you MUST stop and inform the human:**

```
HUMAN: I cannot proceed with development because I'm missing required inputs.

MISSING DOCUMENTS:
- [ ] Feature Technical Specification
- [ ] Feature Test Plan

Please provide both documents before I can begin development. These documents are essential for:
- Understanding exactly what to build
- Ensuring comprehensive test coverage
- Avoiding ambiguity and scope creep
- Meeting project quality standards

Once you provide these documents, I will review them for clarity and completeness.
```

### 2. Review and Validate Input Documents

**If both documents are provided, you MUST review them for ambiguity:**

#### A. Technical Specification Review
Check for these potential ambiguities:
- **Unclear requirements**: Vague or conflicting requirements
- **Missing acceptance criteria**: No clear definition of "done"
- **Undefined interfaces**: Unclear API contracts or data formats
- **Missing constraints**: Performance, security, or compatibility requirements not specified
- **Scope boundaries**: Unclear what's in/out of scope

#### B. Test Plan Review
Check for these potential ambiguities:
- **Incomplete test scenarios**: Missing edge cases or error conditions
- **Unclear test data**: Undefined test data requirements or formats
- **Missing integration points**: Tests don't cover all component interactions
- **Insufficient coverage**: Test plan doesn't meet coverage requirements
- **Unclear test environment**: Test setup and dependencies not specified

**If you find ambiguities, you MUST stop and inform the human:**

```
HUMAN: I've reviewed the provided documents and found ambiguities that need to be resolved.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION AMBIGUITIES:
- [List specific ambiguities found]

TEST PLAN AMBIGUITIES:
- [List specific ambiguities found]

Please update both documents to resolve these ambiguities before I can proceed. Clear, unambiguous requirements are essential for:
- Accurate implementation
- Comprehensive testing
- Meeting quality standards
- Avoiding rework and delays

Once you provide updated documents, I will review them again for completeness.
```

**Only proceed to the next step when both documents are clear and unambiguous.**

### 3. Review Project Standards (MANDATORY)
You MUST read and understand these documents:
- **[Architecture Standards](architecture-standards.md)** - Your coding standards reference
- **[Coverage Requirements](testing-standards/tools-and-automation/coverage_requirements.md)** - Your coverage targets
- **[Testing Standards](testing-standards/testing_standards_readme.md)** - Your testing framework
- **[Test Implementation Guide](testing-standards/test_implementation_guide.md)** - Your test coding patterns
- **[Architecture Overview](architecture.md)** - Your system design reference
- **[Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Your development workflow

### 4. Understand the Feature Requirements
You MUST clarify these points with your human collaborator:
- **Technical Specification**: What exactly are you building? Get clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Architectural Impact**: How does this feature fit into the existing system architecture?
- **Testing Strategy**: What types of tests will be needed (unit, integration, e2e)?
- **Integration Points**: What dependencies and external systems are involved?

### 5. Establish Context
You MUST gather this information:
- **Session History**: Review any previous conversations about this feature
- **Current State**: Understand what's already implemented in the codebase
- **Decision Log**: Document any architectural decisions you make
- **Reference Materials**: Collect relevant documentation and code snippets

## 🚀 Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Test Implementation

**STOP HERE FOR HUMAN REVIEW** - You MUST implement tests before production code

**Note**: The test plan should already be provided and validated in Phase 0. You are now implementing the tests based on that plan.

1. **Create Test File** following [test implementation guide](testing-standards/test_implementation_guide.md):
   ```python
   """
   Test module for [ClassName] class.
   
   This module contains comprehensive tests for the [ClassName] class,
   covering all public methods, error conditions, and edge cases.
   """
   
   import pytest
   from unittest.mock import Mock, patch, MagicMock
   from hypothesis import given, strategies as st
   
   from src.module_name.class_name import ClassName
   ```

2. **Implement Test Classes** following standard structure:
   - `TestClassNameInit` - Constructor and initialization tests
   - `TestClassNameCore` - Core functionality tests
   - `TestClassNameEdgeCases` - Edge cases and error conditions
   - `TestClassNameIntegration` - Integration with dependencies

3. **Use Standard Patterns**:
   - **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern for all tests
   - **Descriptive test names** (e.g., `test_method_name_condition_expected_result`)
   - **Comprehensive docstrings** explaining test purpose
   - **Parametrized tests** for multiple input scenarios
   - **Property-based tests** using hypothesis for comprehensive validation

4. **Mock External Dependencies**:
   - Use `pytest-mock` for external API calls
   - Mock file system operations with `tmp_path` fixture
   - Mock time-dependent operations with `datetime` patching

5. **Verify Test Quality**:
   ```bash
   # Run tests to ensure they fail (red phase)
   pytest tests/test_class_name.py -v
   
   # Check test structure and naming
   pytest --collect-only tests/test_class_name.py
   ```

6. **Submit for Review** - Use this EXACT format:
   ```
   HUMAN: Test implementation complete for [Feature Name].
   
   - All test scenarios implemented

   ```python
   """
   [ClassName] class implementation.
   
   This class provides [brief description of functionality].
   """
   
   from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Any
   import logging
   
   from .exceptions import CustomException
   
   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
   
   
   class ClassName:
       """[Brief description of the class purpose and responsibilities]."""
       
       def __init__(self, param1: str, param2: Optional[int] = None) -> None:
           """Initialize [ClassName] instance.
           
           Args:
               param1: Description of first parameter
               param2: Description of second parameter (optional)
           
           Raises:
               ValueError: If param1 is invalid
           """
           # Minimal implementation to make tests pass
           pass
   ```

## 🛠️ Your Advanced Techniques

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Use these prompts to get better reasoning from AI:

```
Before implementing [feature], let's think through this step by step:

1. What are the key requirements?
2. How does this fit into our existing architecture?
3. What are the potential edge cases?
4. What testing strategy should we use?

Please explain your reasoning before writing any code.
```

### Few-Shot Examples

Provide concrete examples to guide AI output:

```
Here's an example of the coding style and patterns I want:

```python
class ExampleClass:
    """Example class following our standards."""
    
    def __init__(self, param: str) -> None:
        """Initialize with validation.
        
        Args:
            param: Description of parameter
            
        Raises:
            ValueError: If param is invalid
        """
        if not param:
            raise ValueError("Param cannot be empty")
        self.param = param
```

Please follow this exact pattern for the new class.
```

### Error Recovery Strategies

When AI goes off-track:

```
I notice we've deviated from the original requirements. Let's refocus:

1. What was the original goal?
2. Where did we go wrong?
3. How can we get back on track?

Please provide a plan to return to the original scope.
```

### Context Restoration

When context is lost:

```
Let me restore our context:

- We're implementing [feature] for [purpose]
- Current state: [what's implemented]
- Next step: [what we need to do]
- Constraints: [any limitations]

Please confirm you understand this context and proceed.
```
